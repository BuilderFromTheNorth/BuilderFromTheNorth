# 👋 Hi, I'm BuilderFromTheNorth

Self-taught crypto engineer, reverse-engineer, and creator. I work on smart contracts, DeFi tools, Android apps, map analysis tools, and anything that automates or empowers.

I come from a hands-on, engineering-heavy background and now apply that mindset to code, blockchain, and automation. From tuning ECUs to tuning smart contracts.
